Question:

You are given a number N and your task is to write a program to find whether the given number contains an additive sequence or not. The additive sequence is a sequence of numbers where the sum of the first two numbers is equal to the third one.
Note: 
Numbers in the additive sequence cannot have leading zeros.
For Example,
1235 is an additive sequence as 1+2=3, 2+3=5.

Input Description:

The first line contains an integer N (1<=N<=10^20).

Ouput Description:

Print "YES" if the given number contains an additive sequence else print "NO".

Hints:

Add consecutive numbers and check whether the sum of the first two numbers is equal to the third one.

Sample Input:

235813

Sample Output:

YES

Explanation:

In the given number 235813, as 2+3=5, 3+5=8, 5+8=13, hence the it is an additive sequence. So, the output is YES.
